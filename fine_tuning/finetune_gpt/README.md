# Fine-Tuning a GPT Model with OpenAI

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the process of fine-tuning a GPT model using the OpenAI API through **Prompt Tuning**. This approach focuses on optimizing the model's responses by crafting specific prompts without modifying the underlying model weights.

## Contents

- `openai_ft_explained.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that explains the fine-tuning process with detailed comments and markdown explanations, showcasing how to effectively use prompts to guide the model's behavior.
- `academic_ft.jsonl`: The training data file in JSONL format used for fine-tuning the model with task-specific prompts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to fine-tune the GPT model using prompts.

## Technical Overview

### Prompt Tuning

In this project, we utilize **Prompt Tuning** to adapt the GPT model's behavior for specific tasks. By designing effective prompts, we can guide the model to generate desired outputs without altering its internal weights. This method leverages the model's existing capabilities while allowing for flexibility in task performance.

### Training Data

The `academic_ft.jsonl` file contains carefully curated examples that serve as training data for the model. Each entry in this file is designed to demonstrate how to frame prompts effectively, enabling the model to understand and respond appropriately to various queries.
