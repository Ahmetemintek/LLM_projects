# Fine-Tuning Llama 2 with PEFT and LoRA

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to fine-tune the Llama 2 model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models on consumer-grade hardware.

## Contents

- `Fine_tune_Llama_2.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that walks through the fine-tuning process with detailed explanations and implementation steps.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required packages for the notebook.

## Technical Overview

### Key Components

1. **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**
   - Reduces memory usage during training
   - Modifies only a small subset of model parameters
   - Maintains model performance while being computationally efficient

2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
   - Adds trainable rank decomposition matrices to existing weights
   - Significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters
   - Enables fine-tuning on consumer GPUs

3. **QLoRA Integration**
   - Quantized version of LoRA
   - Further reduces memory requirements
   - Makes fine-tuning possible on GPUs with limited VRAM

## Getting Started

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Required packages:
   - transformers
   - peft
   - bitsandbytes
   - accelerate
   - torch
   - datasets

3. Hardware Requirements:
   - Minimum 16GB GPU VRAM recommended
   - Compatible with Google Colab T4/P100 GPUs

4. Follow the notebook instructions for:
   - Loading and preparing the base model
   - Implementing PEFT/LoRA
   - Training process
   - Model evaluation and saving

## Model Publishing

The notebook includes steps for:
- Merging LoRA weights with the base model
- Publishing the fine-tuned model to Hugging Face Hub
- Loading and using the fine-tuned model

## Note

This implementation is designed to work with Llama 2 models. Make sure you have appropriate access and licenses for using Llama 2 models before proceeding with fine-tuning.
